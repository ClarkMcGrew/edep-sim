Release 3.1.0

This provides a few improved features over 3.0.0 aimed at supporting
the simulation of TPCs and running larger production jobs.  It also
includes the accumulated bug fixes.

Changes in 3.1.0

* Improve documentation for the GDML StepLimit auxiliary, and add
  tests.  This is now being actively used in the SAND TPC implemention
  to make sure step by step fluctuctuations are correctly handled.

* Add macro commands to override logical volumes marked with a
  sensitive detectors.  When ```/edep/hitExclude [logicalVolume]``` is
  set segments will not be saved in that volume.

* Allow a threshold for the minimum energy required to save a
  trajectory point.

* Improvements in the trajectory pruning.  This was mostly changes to
  clarify the documentation, but there were minor bug fixes in the
  handling of the minimum deposit required to save a trajectory.

* Support the G4EllipticalTube solid.  This translates it into a
  TGeoEltu object in the root geometry.

* Bug fix: Corrections in the example macros.

* Bug Fix: Trajectories for decay products were being saved when they
  should not have been.  This makes them follow the same "rules" as
  other trajectories.  Decay products can still be treated as a
  primary particle.

* Bug Fix: Protect against NULL pointers in the persistency manager.
  Fix the bunch length simulation to avoid discontinuities.  Improve
  trajectory drawing edep-disp for very large events. 

* Bug Fix: Avoid the deprecated std::random_shuffle, and make sure
  that the G4 random number generator is used when a vector is being
  shuffled.

* Bug Fix: This makes the code match the documentation.  The
  documentation claimed that all trajectories contributing to a hit
  segment were saved, but the code only saved the "primary"
  trajectory.  This now saves all of the contributors like it claims.
